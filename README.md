# alexa-arduino-light-control-ai
A small proof of concept project to connect the Arduino to Alexa audio commands.

## Project Technology

Alexa
Lambda
API Gateway
IAM Permissions / Roles
Arduino UNO
USB serial communication for initial app 
NODE JS as middleware from AWS to Serial

## Project Parts

A: Alexa + Lamda (receive intents and request to update database)

e.g.

Emit from Alexa's Lambda function:

{
   light: 'on'
}

B: Middleware node js server to send information to serial.

e.g.

Send serial data to Arduino: '1' or '0'

C: Handle serial data inside arduino program.

e.g.

if (Serial.read() == '1') {
  digitalWrite(led, HIGH);
}

## Project goals (Part 1)

This project will demonstrate how an arduino can be connected to Alexa and the related AWS services to provide a way to control electronic components. 

- Build an interface with Alexa and services
- Create a method to send Serial data to Arduino (Lambda enpoint to serial data)
- Seamlessly interact with Alexa to control the component using ON / OFF as commands to control the light

## Project goals (Part 2 - this will be created in another repository)

- Use Websockets and AWS IOT service
- Using WIFI or Bluetooth Arduino components
- Create a way to allow for the application to become smarter
- Include a light sensor
- Add logic to turn the light on and off when light / dark 
- Apply the users perferences to override the initial settings

## Application Flow of hardware and software components

This diagram illustrates the technology parts needed to replicate this project, also providing and overview of the applications data flow.

- Alexa device (Echo Dot, or another Alexa enabled hardware device)
- Alexa Led Test skill (this is the skill created to understand the intents and slot in this demo)
- Lambda instance A is responsible for connecting to Alexa, interpreting (converted inputs) and writting them to the db.
- A Dynamo DB instance is used to store the data from the input
- Lambda instance B is responsible for reading the database (trimming the instance id from its data output)
- API Gateways serves a get request to read from our Lambda function's output
- Node Application is used as a headless API to receive, transform and send data to the arduino via the serial
- Arduino is programmed to recieve data from the serial port and control the Led as per user request.

## DEV notes

Screen can be used to talk to the serial port via the terminal - screen /dev/ttyS0 19200
